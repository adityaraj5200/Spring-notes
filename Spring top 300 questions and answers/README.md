**#1. What is the Spring Framework?**

Spring is an open-source Java framework for building enterprise-grade applications.

Its main purpose is to simplify Java development by:

- **Managing objects** through an IoC (Inversion of Control) container.
- **Decoupling components** using Dependency Injection (DI).
- **Reducing boilerplate code** with built-in abstractions.
- **Providing modular architecture** ‚Äî developers can use only the parts they need, like Spring MVC for web apps, Spring Data for persistence, or Spring Security for authentication.

Example usage in real life:

Instead of writing all the JDBC boilerplate code for DB connections, transactions, and exception handling, Spring Data abstracts it, so you just write repository interfaces.

---

**#2. What is Inversion of Control (IoC) in Spring?**

IoC is a design principle where the control of object creation, configuration, and lifecycle is shifted from the developer to a framework (in this case, the Spring IoC container).

**Without IoC (Traditional Java)**:

```java
Car car = new Car(new Engine());

```

Here, the `Car` class is responsible for creating the `Engine` ‚Äî tightly coupled.

**With IoC (Spring)**:

```java

@Component
class Car {
    private final Engine engine;
    @Autowired
    Car(Engine engine) { this.engine = engine; }
}

```

The Spring container **injects** the `Engine` instance automatically.

**Why it matters in interviews:**

IoC enables **loose coupling**, better testability (via mocks), and flexible configuration.

---

**#3. What is Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring and its types?**

Dependency Injection is the process of providing required dependencies to a class from outside rather than creating them internally. In Spring, the IoC container manages DI.

**Types in Spring**:

1. **Constructor Injection** (Preferred in most cases)
    
    ```java
    @Component
    class Car {
        private final Engine engine;
        @Autowired
        Car(Engine engine) { this.engine = engine; }
    }
    
    ```
    
    - Immutable dependencies
    - Easier testing
2. **Setter Injection**
    
    ```java
    @Component
    class Car {
        private Engine engine;
        @Autowired
        public void setEngine(Engine engine) { this.engine = engine; }
    }
    
    ```
    
    - Allows changing dependencies later.
3. **Field Injection** (Not recommended ‚Äî hard to test)
    
    ```java
    @Autowired
    private Engine engine;
    
    ```
    

**Common interview pitfall:**

If you mix constructor and field injection without care, you may introduce circular dependencies.

---

**#4. What is a Spring Bean and how is it created?**

A Spring Bean is any object that is **managed by the Spring IoC container**.

It goes through a defined **lifecycle**: instantiation ‚Üí dependency injection ‚Üí initialization ‚Üí destruction.

**Ways to define a Bean**:

1. **Annotation-based**
    
    ```java
    @Component
    public class Engine {}
    
    ```
    
2. **Java Configuration**
    
    ```java
    @Configuration
    public class AppConfig {
        @Bean
        public Engine engine() {
            return new Engine();
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
3. **XML Configuration** (legacy)

**Key point for interviews:**

All Beans are singletons by default unless scope is changed.

---

**#5. Explain Bean Scopes in Spring.**

Bean scope defines how many instances of a bean are created and how they are shared.

**Common scopes**:

1. `singleton` (default) ‚Äî One instance per Spring container.
2. `prototype` ‚Äî New instance every time it‚Äôs requested.
3. `request` ‚Äî One instance per HTTP request (web apps only).
4. `session` ‚Äî One instance per HTTP session.
5. `application` ‚Äî One instance per ServletContext.

**Example**:

```java
@Scope("prototype")
@Component
public class Engine {}

```

**Interview insight:**

Using `prototype` for heavy objects can cause performance issues; `singleton` is better unless you need per-use instantiation.

**When to use each Spring bean scope:**
#### **1. Singleton** *(Default)*

- **Behavior:** One shared instance for the entire Spring container.
- **When to use:**
    - Bean is **stateless** (no instance variables holding request-specific data).
    - Configuration, utility, or service classes.
- **Example:** Service classes in business layer.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid if:** Bean holds user/request-specific state ‚Äî it will cause thread-safety issues.

---

#### **2. prototype**

- **Behavior:** A new instance is created **every time** it‚Äôs requested from the container.
- **When to use:**
    - Bean is **stateful** and needs to be used for short-lived tasks.
    - Per-job processors, DTO builders, or objects that should not be reused.
- **Example:** Batch processing jobs where each job needs a fresh object.

---

#### **3. request** *(Web scope)*

- **Behavior:** One bean per **HTTP request**.
- **When to use:**
    - You need to store and process **request-specific** data.
- **Example:** Objects holding request parameters or computed results for that request only.

---

#### **4. session** *(Web scope)*

- **Behavior:** One bean per **HTTP session**.
- **When to use:**
    - Maintain **user-specific state** across multiple requests in the same session.
- **Example:** Shopping cart, user session details.

---

#### **5. application** *(Web scope)*

- **Behavior:** One bean per **ServletContext** (shared across sessions).
- **When to use:**
    - Application-wide data that should be shared between users.
- **Example:** Global cache, system configuration.

---

#### **6. websocket** *(Web scope)*

- **Behavior:** One bean per WebSocket session.
- **When to use:**
    - Store data for a WebSocket connection.
- **Example:** Live chat session handler.

---

### **üìå Quick Decision Table**

| Scope | Lifespan | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **singleton** | Entire app | Stateless services, shared config |
| **prototype** | Each request for bean | Short-lived, stateful objects |
| **request** | HTTP request | Request-scoped data in web apps |
| **session** | HTTP session | User-specific state |
| **application** | ServletContext | App-wide shared resources |
| **websocket** | WebSocket session | WebSocket-specific state |

### Easy #6‚Äì10

**#6. What is the difference between `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller`?**

All four are stereotype annotations in Spring that mark classes as beans for component scanning.

- `@Component` ‚Äì Generic bean, used when the class doesn‚Äôt fit in any specialized category.
- `@Service` ‚Äì Specialization of `@Component` for service layer classes, often containing business logic.
- `@Repository` ‚Äì Specialization of `@Component` for DAO classes. It also translates database exceptions into Spring‚Äôs `DataAccessException`.
- `@Controller` ‚Äì Specialization of `@Component` for MVC controllers that return views.
- `@RestController` ‚Äì Combination of `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody` for REST APIs.

---

**#7. Explain the Spring Bean lifecycle.**

1. **Instantiation** ‚Äì The bean is created.
2. **Populate Properties** ‚Äì Dependencies are injected.
3. **BeanNameAware** ‚Äì The bean name is provided.
4. **BeanFactoryAware/ApplicationContextAware** ‚Äì The container reference is provided.
5. **PostConstruct** ‚Äì Methods annotated with `@PostConstruct` run.
6. **InitializingBean.afterPropertiesSet()** ‚Äì Initialization callback.
7. **Custom init-method** ‚Äì If configured.
8. **BeanPostProcessor.beforeInitialization** ‚Äì Runs before initialization methods.
9. **BeanPostProcessor.afterInitialization** ‚Äì Runs after initialization methods.
10. **Usage** ‚Äì Bean is ready for use.
11. **PreDestroy** ‚Äì Methods annotated with `@PreDestroy` run before destruction.
12. **DisposableBean.destroy()** ‚Äì Destruction callback.
13. **Custom destroy-method** ‚Äì If configured.

---

**#8. What is the role of `@Configuration` and `@Bean` in Spring?**

- `@Configuration` marks a class as a source of bean definitions.
- `@Bean` defines a bean method inside a `@Configuration` class. The returned object is registered as a bean in the Spring container.

Example:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public Engine engine() {
        return new Engine();
    }
}

```

`@Bean` is used when you want fine-grained control over bean instantiation, configuration, or when integrating third-party classes not annotated with `@Component`.

---

**#9. What is `@Autowired` and how does it work?**

`@Autowired` tells Spring to resolve and inject a bean dependency automatically. By default, it uses **by-type autowiring**.

It can be used on:

- Constructors
- Setter methods
- Fields

Example:

```java
@Component
public class Car {
    private final Engine engine;
    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}

```

If multiple beans of the same type exist, use `@Qualifier` to specify which bean to inject.

---

**#10. What is the difference between constructor injection and setter injection?**

- **Constructor Injection**
    - Dependencies are provided at object creation time.
    - Promotes immutability.
    - Mandatory dependencies are clearly expressed.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        @Autowired
        public Car(Engine engine) { this.engine = engine; }
        
        ```
        
- **Setter Injection**
    - Dependencies can be changed after object creation.
    - Useful for optional dependencies.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        @Autowired
        public void setEngine(Engine engine) { this.engine = engine; }
        
        ```
        

Constructor injection is generally preferred because it makes the bean immutable and ensures required dependencies are not null.

### Easy #11‚Äì15

**#11. What is the difference between `@ComponentScan` and `@EnableAutoConfiguration`?**

- `@ComponentScan` tells Spring where to look for components (`@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`).
    
    Example:
    
    ```java
    @Configuration
    @ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.project")
    public class AppConfig {}
    
    ```
    
- `@EnableAutoConfiguration` (in Spring Boot) automatically configures beans based on classpath dependencies. For example, if `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` is on the classpath, it configures a `DataSource` automatically.

**Pitfall:**

If you rely only on `@EnableAutoConfiguration` without controlling `@ComponentScan`, you may unintentionally load unwanted beans, causing conflicts or performance issues.

---

**#12. What is the difference between `ApplicationContext` and `BeanFactory`?**

- `BeanFactory` is the core IoC container that instantiates and manages beans. It‚Äôs lazy ‚Äî beans are created only when requested.
- `ApplicationContext` is a superset of `BeanFactory` that includes:
    - Eager bean loading by default.
    - Event publishing.
    - Internationalization support.
    - AOP integration.
    - Environment property resolution.

**Gotcha:**

In real-world apps, you almost always use `ApplicationContext` because it includes `BeanFactory` features plus many enterprise-level capabilities.

---

**#13. What is `@Qualifier` and when do you use it?**

`@Qualifier` is used along with `@Autowired` to resolve ambiguity when multiple beans of the same type exist.

Example:

```java
@Component("dieselEngine")
public class DieselEngine implements Engine {}

@Component("petrolEngine")
public class PetrolEngine implements Engine {}

@Component
public class Car {
    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("dieselEngine")
    private Engine engine;
}

```

**Pitfall:**

If you forget to use `@Qualifier` when multiple beans of the same type exist, Spring will throw `NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException`.

---

**#14. Explain the difference between `@Primary` and `@Qualifier`.**

- `@Primary` marks a bean as the default candidate when multiple beans of the same type exist.
- `@Qualifier` explicitly specifies the bean name to be injected.

Example:

```java
@Component
@Primary
public class DieselEngine implements Engine {}

@Component
public class PetrolEngine implements Engine {}

```

If you inject `Engine` without a qualifier, `DieselEngine` will be used.

**Gotcha:**

If both `@Primary` and `@Qualifier` are present, `@Qualifier` always overrides `@Primary`.

---

**#15. What are Spring Profiles and how are they used?**

Spring Profiles allow you to define different configurations for different environments (dev, test, prod).

Example:

```java
@Configuration
@Profile("dev")
public class DevConfig {
    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource() { ... }
}

@Configuration
@Profile("prod")
public class ProdConfig {
    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource() { ... }
}

```

Activate a profile:

- Command-line: `-spring.profiles.active=dev`
- application.properties: `spring.profiles.active=prod`

**Pitfall:**

If no active profile is set and beans are profile-specific, you may get `NoSuchBeanDefinitionException`. Always have a default configuration if possible.

### Easy #16‚Äì20

**#16. What is the difference between `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy`?**

- `@PostConstruct` ‚Äì Runs after dependency injection is done and before the bean is put into service. Used for initialization logic.
- `@PreDestroy` ‚Äì Runs just before the bean is destroyed. Used for cleanup logic.

Example:

```java
@Component
public class ResourceHandler {
    @PostConstruct
    public void init() { System.out.println("Init resource"); }

    @PreDestroy
    public void cleanup() { System.out.println("Cleanup resource"); }
}

```

**Pitfall:**

These annotations require a JSR-250 dependency (`jakarta.annotation-api` in recent versions). If missing, they won‚Äôt work silently.

---

**#17. How does Spring handle singleton beans in a multi-threaded environment?**

Spring‚Äôs singleton scope means **one bean instance per container**, not per thread.

If the bean is **stateless**, it‚Äôs safe in multi-threaded environments.

If the bean is **stateful** (holds mutable state), you must ensure thread safety manually (e.g., `synchronized`, thread-local storage).

**Gotcha:**

Many assume singleton beans are thread-safe by default ‚Äî they are not if they have mutable fields.

---

**#18. What are the different bean scopes in Spring?**

- **singleton** (default) ‚Äì One instance per Spring IoC container.
- **prototype** ‚Äì New instance each time it‚Äôs requested.
- **request** ‚Äì One instance per HTTP request (web-aware context).
- **session** ‚Äì One instance per HTTP session.
- **application** ‚Äì One instance per `ServletContext`.
- **websocket** ‚Äì One instance per WebSocket session.

Example:

```java
@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class PrototypeBean {}

```

**Pitfall:**

If you inject a prototype bean into a singleton bean, it will still behave like a singleton unless you use `ObjectFactory` or `Provider` to fetch a new instance each time.

---

**#19. Explain the difference between `BeanPostProcessor` and `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`.**

- **BeanFactoryPostProcessor** ‚Äì Runs before bean instantiation. Used to modify bean definitions (metadata).
- **BeanPostProcessor** ‚Äì Runs after bean instantiation but before initialization methods. Used to modify bean instances.

Example:

```java
@Component
public class CustomBeanPostProcessor implements BeanPostProcessor {
    public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) { return bean; }
}

```

**Gotcha:**

Mixing them up is common ‚Äî `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` changes definitions, `BeanPostProcessor` changes actual objects.

---

**#20. How does Spring resolve circular dependencies?**

- For **singleton beans**, Spring uses **early references** by creating bean instances first, then injecting dependencies afterward.
- For **constructor injection**, circular dependencies cause a `BeanCurrentlyInCreationException`.
- For **prototype beans**, circular dependencies are not resolved automatically.

**Pitfall:**

Many assume Spring can handle all circular dependencies ‚Äî but it only works for setter injection with singletons. Constructor cycles must be refactored.

### Easy #21‚Äì25

**#21. What is the role of `@Configuration` in Spring?**

`@Configuration` marks a class as a source of bean definitions for the Spring container. Methods annotated with `@Bean` inside it are processed to produce and register beans.

Example:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyServiceImpl();
    }
}

```

**Gotcha:**

If you forget `@Configuration` (and only use `@Bean`), Spring will still register the bean but without CGLIB enhancement ‚Äî meaning `@Bean` methods calling other `@Bean` methods will create **new instances** instead of returning the same singleton.

---

**#22. Difference between `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller`?**

All are specializations of `@Component`, used for stereotype annotation and readability:

- **`@Component`** ‚Äì Generic Spring-managed component.
- **`@Service`** ‚Äì Marks a service-layer class; can carry business logic.
- **`@Repository`** ‚Äì Marks a data-access object (DAO); adds exception translation for persistence exceptions.
- **`@Controller`** ‚Äì Marks a Spring MVC controller.

**Pitfall:**

Mixing them doesn‚Äôt affect functionality much, but using correct stereotypes improves clarity and lets Spring apply role-specific features (like `@Repository` exception translation).

---

**#23. What is dependency injection in Spring and its types?**

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where the container supplies dependencies to objects instead of objects creating them.

Types in Spring:

1. **Constructor Injection**
    
    ```java
    @Component
    public class Car {
        private final Engine engine;
        @Autowired
        public Car(Engine engine) { this.engine = engine; }
    }
    
    ```
    
2. **Setter Injection**
    
    ```java
    @Component
    public class Car {
        private Engine engine;
        @Autowired
        public void setEngine(Engine engine) { this.engine = engine; }
    }
    
    ```
    
3. **Field Injection** (not recommended for testing and immutability reasons)
    
    ```java
    @Autowired
    private Engine engine;
    
    ```
    

**Gotcha:**

Constructor injection is preferred for immutability and ensuring required dependencies at creation time.

---

**#24. What is the difference between `@Bean` and `@Component`?**

- `@Bean` is used in `@Configuration` classes to define beans manually.
- `@Component` is used on the class itself to let Spring autodetect and register it via classpath scanning.

Example:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyService myService() { return new MyServiceImpl(); }
}

```

vs.

```java
@Component
public class MyServiceImpl implements MyService {}

```

**Gotcha:**

`@Bean` gives full control over bean creation logic (including calling constructors with parameters, conditional creation, etc.), while `@Component` is limited to default constructor or Spring-injected dependencies.

---

**#25. What is `@Lazy` in Spring?**

`@Lazy` tells Spring to delay bean initialization until it is first requested, rather than at container startup (default for singleton beans is eager loading).

Example:

```java
@Component
@Lazy
public class HeavyService { ... }

```

You can also mark dependencies as lazy:

```java
@Autowired
@Lazy
private HeavyService service;

```

**Pitfall:**

Lazy loading can hide initialization errors until runtime, which might make them harder to detect early in development.

### Easy #26‚Äì30

**#26. How does `@Primary` work in Spring?**

When multiple beans of the same type are present, Spring needs a way to decide which one to inject by default.

`@Primary` marks a bean as the preferred choice when no qualifier is specified.

Example:

```java
@Component
@Primary
public class MySqlDataSource implements DataSource {}

@Component
public class PostgresDataSource implements DataSource {}

```

If you `@Autowired` `DataSource` without `@Qualifier`, Spring injects `MySqlDataSource`.

**Gotcha:**

`@Primary` only resolves conflicts if no `@Qualifier` is used. Once `@Qualifier` is applied, `@Primary` is ignored.

---

**#27. Difference between `@Autowired` and `@Qualifier`?**

- `@Autowired` tells Spring to inject a dependency automatically by type.
- If multiple candidates exist, you use `@Qualifier` to specify the exact bean by name.

Example:

```java
@Autowired
@Qualifier("postgresDataSource")
private DataSource dataSource;

```

**Gotcha:**

If you have multiple beans and don‚Äôt use `@Qualifier` or `@Primary`, Spring throws `NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException`.

---

**#28. What is the default bean initialization order in Spring?**

Spring initializes beans in the following general sequence:

1. Instantiate bean
2. Set properties (DI)
3. Call `BeanNameAware`, `BeanFactoryAware` methods (if implemented)
4. Call `BeanPostProcessor.postProcessBeforeInitialization()`
5. Call `@PostConstruct` or `InitializingBean.afterPropertiesSet()`
6. Call `BeanPostProcessor.postProcessAfterInitialization()`

**Pitfall:**

The actual order can vary if `@DependsOn` or bean dependencies influence the initialization sequence.

---

**#29. How does `@DependsOn` work?**

`@DependsOn` forces Spring to initialize certain beans before the annotated bean.

Example:

```java
@Component
@DependsOn("dataSource")
public class Repository {}

```

**Gotcha:**

`@DependsOn` only controls *initialization order*, not *injection order*. Injection still happens normally based on dependency requirements.

---

**#30. How to create a bean without using `@Component` or `@Bean`?**

- Use XML configuration:

```xml
<bean id="myService" class="com.example.MyServiceImpl"/>

```

- Or register it programmatically in a `BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor` or using `GenericApplicationContext.registerBean()`.

**Gotcha:**

Manual registration is useful for dynamic beans (e.g., loaded from config at runtime) but can reduce readability and maintainability.

### Easy #31‚Äì35

**#31. What is `ApplicationContext` in Spring?**

`ApplicationContext` is the central interface for accessing the Spring container. It manages bean creation, dependency injection, lifecycle management, and resource loading.

Example:

```java
ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
MyService service = context.getBean(MyService.class);

```

**Gotcha:**

`ApplicationContext` loads all singleton beans eagerly by default, unlike `BeanFactory` which is lazy.

---

**#32. Difference between `ApplicationContext` and `BeanFactory`?**

- **`BeanFactory`**: Basic container, lazy initialization, lightweight.
- **`ApplicationContext`**: Extends `BeanFactory`, adds internationalization, event publication, annotation processing, and eager singleton loading.

**Interview trap:**

If asked which to use ‚Äî always prefer `ApplicationContext` for modern applications unless you have extreme memory constraints.

---

**#33. How does Spring handle bean scopes?**

Common scopes:

1. **singleton** ‚Äì one instance per Spring container (default).
2. **prototype** ‚Äì new instance each time requested.
3. **request** ‚Äì one instance per HTTP request (Web apps only).
4. **session** ‚Äì one per HTTP session.
5. **application** ‚Äì one per `ServletContext`.

Example:

```java
@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class MyBean {}

```

**Gotcha:**

Injecting a prototype bean into a singleton bean will still behave like a singleton unless retrieved via `ObjectFactory` or `Provider`.

---

**#34. What is a `BeanPostProcessor` in Spring?**

`BeanPostProcessor` allows custom modification of new bean instances before and after initialization callbacks.

Example:

```java
@Component
public class MyPostProcessor implements BeanPostProcessor {
    public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String name) {
        return bean;
    }
    public Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String name) {
        return bean;
    }
}

```

**Gotcha:**

A common trap is expecting constructor logic to be affected by `BeanPostProcessor` ‚Äî it runs *after* instantiation.

---

**#35. What is the use of `@Value` annotation?**

`@Value` injects values into bean fields from property files, system properties, or SpEL (Spring Expression Language).

Example:

```java
@Value("${app.name}")
private String appName;

```

Supports expressions:

```java
@Value("#{2 * T(Math).PI}")
private double circle;

```

**Gotcha:**

`@Value` injection happens after the constructor ‚Äî so you cannot use injected values inside constructor initialization logic without `@PostConstruct`.

### Easy #36‚Äì40

**#36. How does Spring resolve property values from `.properties` or `.yml` files?**

Spring uses `PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer` (in classic Spring) or auto-configured environment processing in Spring Boot to resolve `${...}` placeholders from property files.

Example in Boot:

```java
// application.properties
app.name=MyApp

```

```java
@Value("${app.name}")
private String appName;

```

**Gotcha:**

In classic Spring (non-Boot), you must explicitly declare `PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer` as a bean; without it, `${...}` placeholders will not resolve.

---

**#37. Difference between `@Configuration` and `@Component`?**

- **`@Component`**: Marks a class as a candidate for component scanning, creating a bean of that class.
- **`@Configuration`**: A specialized `@Component` that also allows defining beans via `@Bean` methods. It enables full CGLIB proxying for method calls to other `@Bean` methods within the same class.

Example:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyService service() { return new MyServiceImpl(); }
}

```

**Gotcha:**

If `@Configuration` is replaced with `@Component`, `@Bean` methods will not be proxied, and each call will create a new instance instead of returning the singleton from the context.

---

**#38. What is the difference between `@PostConstruct` and `InitializingBean.afterPropertiesSet()`?**

Both are used to run initialization logic after dependency injection:

- **`@PostConstruct`**: Preferred, framework-independent, works with any managed bean.
- **`afterPropertiesSet()`**: Part of Spring‚Äôs `InitializingBean` interface.

Example:

```java
@PostConstruct
public void init() {
    // initialization logic
}

```

**Gotcha:**

`@PostConstruct` runs after `afterPropertiesSet()` when both are present in the same bean.

---

**#39. What is `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`?**

It allows modification of bean definitions (metadata) before the beans are instantiated.

Example:

```java
@Component
public class MyBeanFactoryPostProcessor implements BeanFactoryPostProcessor {
    public void postProcessBeanFactory(ConfigurableListableBeanFactory factory) {
        BeanDefinition bd = factory.getBeanDefinition("myBean");
        bd.setScope(BeanDefinition.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE);
    }
}

```

**Gotcha:**

You cannot access bean instances here ‚Äî only definitions. Attempting to fetch a bean will cause premature instantiation.

---

**#40. How to load an external property file in Spring Boot?**

1. Place it in `src/main/resources` ‚Äî automatically loaded.
2. Or specify location via `@PropertySource`:

```java
@Configuration
@PropertySource("classpath:custom.properties")
public class AppConfig {}

```

**Gotcha:**

When using YAML (`.yml`), `@PropertySource` doesn‚Äôt work ‚Äî you need to rely on Spring Boot‚Äôs built-in YAML parsing or use `YamlPropertySourceLoader`.

### Easy #41‚Äì45

**#41. What is `@Primary` annotation in Spring?**

`@Primary` marks a bean as the default candidate for autowiring when multiple beans of the same type exist.

Example:

```java
@Component
@Primary
public class PrimaryService implements MyService {}

@Component
public class SecondaryService implements MyService {}

```

```java
@Autowired
private MyService service; // Injects PrimaryService

```

**Gotcha:**

`@Primary` resolves ambiguity globally. For selective injection, use `@Qualifier` instead.

---

**#42. How does `@Qualifier` work in Spring?**

`@Qualifier` specifies which bean to inject when multiple candidates exist.

Example:

```java
@Component("fastService")
public class FastService implements MyService {}

@Component("slowService")
public class SlowService implements MyService {}

@Autowired
@Qualifier("fastService")
private MyService service;

```

**Gotcha:**

If both `@Primary` and `@Qualifier` are present, `@Qualifier` takes precedence.

---

**#43. Explain `@Lazy` annotation in Spring.**

`@Lazy` delays bean initialization until it is first requested.

Example:

```java
@Component
@Lazy
public class HeavyBean {
    public HeavyBean() { System.out.println("Initialized"); }
}

```

**Gotcha:**

`@Lazy` on a singleton delays instantiation, but once created, it stays in memory. For `@Lazy` prototypes, Spring still creates new instances each time.

---

**#44. What is the difference between `@Bean` and `@Component` in Spring?**

- **`@Component`**: Marks a class for component scanning; Spring creates the bean automatically.
- **`@Bean`**: Declares a bean inside a `@Configuration` class manually.

Example:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyService service() { return new MyServiceImpl(); }
}

```

**Gotcha:**

`@Bean` gives more control ‚Äî you can configure bean parameters and dependencies programmatically.

---

**#45. How does Spring handle circular dependencies?**

Spring resolves circular dependencies for singleton beans by using early references before full initialization.

Example:

```java
@Component
public class A {
    @Autowired private B b;
}

@Component
public class B {
    @Autowired private A a;
}

```

**Gotcha:**

Constructor-based injection fails in circular dependencies ‚Äî you must use setter or field injection. In Spring Boot 2.6+, circular references are disabled by default unless `spring.main.allow-circular-references=true`.

### Easy #46‚Äì50

**#46. What is `@Scope` in Spring?**

`@Scope` defines the lifecycle and visibility of a bean.

Common scopes:

- `singleton` ‚Äî one instance per container (default).
- `prototype` ‚Äî new instance per request.
- `request`, `session`, `application` ‚Äî web-specific scopes.

Example:

```java
@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class PrototypeBean {}

```

**Gotcha:**

When injecting a prototype into a singleton, the prototype is instantiated only once at singleton creation unless you use `ObjectFactory` or `Provider` to get fresh instances.

---

**#47. Explain `@DependsOn` annotation in Spring.**

`@DependsOn` forces Spring to initialize specified beans before the current bean.

Example:

```java
@Component
@DependsOn("dataSource")
public class MyRepository {}

```

**Gotcha:**

This affects initialization order, not dependency injection. It doesn‚Äôt create an actual dependency link ‚Äî removing the bean name in `@DependsOn` may still compile but fail at runtime.

---

**#48. What is the difference between `ApplicationContext` and `BeanFactory`?**

- **BeanFactory** ‚Äî basic container, lazy loads beans, no advanced features.
- **ApplicationContext** ‚Äî extends BeanFactory, eager loads singletons, supports internationalization, event propagation, and AOP.

Example:

```java
ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("appConfig.xml");

```

**Gotcha:**

Use `ApplicationContext` in most applications; `BeanFactory` is typically used for lightweight or memory-critical environments.

---

**#49. How does `@Value` differ from `Environment` in property injection?**

- `@Value` ‚Äî injects a single property directly into a field, constructor, or method parameter.
- `Environment` ‚Äî retrieves properties programmatically.

Example:

```java
@Value("${app.timeout}")
private int timeout;

@Autowired
private Environment env;
int timeoutValue = env.getProperty("app.timeout", Integer.class);

```

**Gotcha:**

`@Value` is resolved during bean creation; `Environment` can fetch updated values at runtime if the source changes and refresh is supported.

---

**#50. How can you create conditional beans in Spring?**

Use `@Conditional` or Spring Boot‚Äôs `@ConditionalOn...` annotations.

Example:

```java
@Bean
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "feature.enabled", havingValue = "true")
public FeatureService featureService() { return new FeatureService(); }

```

**Gotcha:**

Condition checks happen at context refresh time ‚Äî you can‚Äôt change the condition later without restarting or refreshing the context.

### Easy #51‚Äì55

**#51. What is the `@Profile` annotation in Spring?**

`@Profile` allows you to register beans conditionally based on the active environment profile(s).

Example:

```java
@Component
@Profile("dev")
public class DevDataSourceConfig implements DataSourceConfig {}

@Component
@Profile("prod")
public class ProdDataSourceConfig implements DataSourceConfig {}

```

Profiles are activated via:

```
spring.profiles.active=dev

```

**Gotcha:**

If no profile is active and a bean is tied only to specific profiles, it won‚Äôt load ‚Äî causing `NoSuchBeanDefinitionException`.

---

**#52. What is `@ConfigurationProperties` in Spring Boot?**

`@ConfigurationProperties` maps external properties into a Java bean.

Example:

```java
@Component
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "app")
public class AppConfig {
    private String name;
    private int timeout;
    // getters & setters
}

```

```
app.name=MyApp
app.timeout=5000

```

**Gotcha:**

Requires `@EnableConfigurationProperties` (if not annotated with `@Component`) and proper setters ‚Äî otherwise binding will fail silently.

---

**#53. What is `ApplicationEventPublisher` in Spring?**

It‚Äôs used to publish events to listeners within the Spring context.

Example:

```java
@Component
public class OrderService {
    @Autowired
    private ApplicationEventPublisher publisher;

    public void placeOrder(Order order) {
        publisher.publishEvent(new OrderCreatedEvent(this, order));
    }
}

```

**Gotcha:**

Events are synchronous by default. Use `@Async` on listeners for async processing, but ensure an `AsyncConfigurer` or `@EnableAsync` is configured.

---

**#54. What is `@PostConstruct` and when is it called?**

`@PostConstruct` marks a method to run after dependency injection is done but before the bean is available for use.

Example:

```java
@PostConstruct
public void init() {
    cache.load();
}

```

**Gotcha:**

Only works on singletons by default. For prototype beans, it runs right after instantiation of each instance.

---

**#55. What is the `@PreDestroy` annotation in Spring?**

`@PreDestroy` marks a method to run before the bean is destroyed.

Example:

```java
@PreDestroy
public void cleanup() {
    connection.close();
}

```

**Gotcha:**

Called only for singleton beans in the application context. For prototype beans, Spring does not manage destruction lifecycle ‚Äî you must clean up manually.

### Easy #56‚Äì60

**#56. How do you access the Spring ApplicationContext inside a bean?**

Implement `ApplicationContextAware` or use dependency injection.

Example (via interface):

```java
@Component
public class MyBean implements ApplicationContextAware {
    private ApplicationContext context;
    @Override
    public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext ctx) {
        this.context = ctx;
    }
}

```

**Gotcha:**

Directly accessing `ApplicationContext` breaks the dependency inversion principle ‚Äî use only when absolutely necessary.

---

**#57. What is the difference between `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller`?**

All are specializations of `@Component` with semantic meaning:

- `@Component` ‚Äî generic Spring bean.
- `@Service` ‚Äî service-layer beans.
- `@Repository` ‚Äî DAO beans, adds exception translation for persistence errors.
- `@Controller` ‚Äî web controller for MVC.

**Gotcha:**

Functionally they behave the same for component scanning, but `@Repository` enables persistence exception translation automatically.

---

**#58. What is `BeanPostProcessor` in Spring?**

`BeanPostProcessor` allows custom modification of new bean instances after instantiation but before initialization.

Example:

```java
@Component
public class CustomBeanPostProcessor implements BeanPostProcessor {
    public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) {
        return bean;
    }
    public Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) {
        return bean;
    }
}

```

**Gotcha:**

It applies to all beans in the context, so logic must filter by `beanName` or `bean` type to avoid unnecessary overhead.

---

**#59. How does Spring resolve bean injection by type and by name?**

- By default, Spring injects by **type** (matching the bean‚Äôs class/interface).
- If multiple candidates match, Spring tries **by name** matching the field or parameter name to a bean‚Äôs name.

**Gotcha:**

Ambiguity without `@Qualifier` or `@Primary` leads to `NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException`.

---

**#60. What is `FactoryBean` in Spring?**

`FactoryBean` is a special bean that returns an object instance from its `getObject()` method instead of being injected directly.

Example:

```java
@Component
public class MyFactoryBean implements FactoryBean<MyService> {
    public MyService getObject() { return new MyServiceImpl(); }
    public Class<?> getObjectType() { return MyService.class; }
}

```

**Gotcha:**

To get the factory itself instead of its product, prefix the bean name with `&` when retrieving from the context.

### Easy #61‚Äì65

**#61. How do you inject a collection of beans in Spring?**

Spring can inject all beans of a given type into a `List`, `Set`, or `Map`.

Example:

```java
@Autowired
private List<PaymentProcessor> processors;

```

This injects all `PaymentProcessor` beans in the application context.

**Gotcha:**

Order is not guaranteed unless you use `@Order` or implement `Ordered` interface on beans.

---

**#62. What is the difference between `@Primary` and `@Qualifier`?**

- `@Primary` ‚Äî sets a bean as the default when multiple candidates exist.
- `@Qualifier` ‚Äî explicitly specifies which bean to inject.

Example:

```java
@Primary
@Component
public class PayPalProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {}

@Component
@Qualifier("stripe")
public class StripeProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {}

```

**Gotcha:**

`@Primary` works globally, while `@Qualifier` overrides it for specific injection points.

---

**#63. How can you define bean initialization and destruction methods without annotations?**

You can specify them in XML or in `@Bean` method attributes.

Example (Java Config):

```java
@Bean(initMethod = "init", destroyMethod = "shutdown")
public CacheService cacheService() {
    return new CacheService();
}

```

**Gotcha:**

When using `destroyMethod`, remember that Spring will attempt to call it on context shutdown ‚Äî ensure it exists or set `destroyMethod=""` to disable.

---

**#64. What is a singleton bean in Spring and how is it different from the Singleton design pattern?**

In Spring, a singleton bean means **one instance per Spring container**, not per JVM like the classic Singleton pattern.

**Gotcha:**

Multiple application contexts mean multiple instances of a ‚Äúsingleton‚Äù bean.

---

**#65. How can you lazily initialize beans in Spring?**

Use `@Lazy` at class or injection point level.

Example:

```java
@Component
@Lazy
public class HeavyService {}

```

**Gotcha:**

Lazy initialization delays creation until first use, but for circular dependencies in singleton beans, this can cause runtime errors if the bean is needed during another bean's initialization.

### Easy #66‚Äì70

**#66. What is the role of `@Value` in Spring?**

`@Value` injects values from property files, system properties, or SpEL (Spring Expression Language) directly into fields, methods, or constructor parameters.

Example:

```java
@Value("${app.name}")
private String appName;

@Value("#{2 * 1024}")
private int bufferSize;

```

**Gotcha:**

If the property is missing, injection fails unless you provide a default:

```java
@Value("${app.name:DefaultApp}")

```

---

**#67. What is the `Environment` interface used for in Spring?**

The `Environment` interface provides access to environment properties, profiles, and property sources.

Example:

```java
@Autowired
private Environment env;

public void printProfile() {
    System.out.println(env.getActiveProfiles());
}

```

**Gotcha:**

Use `Environment` when you need programmatic property access; prefer `@Value` for static injection.

---

**#68. How do you make a bean conditional in Spring?**

Use `@Conditional` with a custom `Condition` implementation.

Example:

```java
@Bean
@Conditional(OnWindowsCondition.class)
public MyService windowsService() { return new WindowsService(); }

```

**Gotcha:**

`@Profile` is a special case of `@Conditional`, but `@Conditional` offers more flexibility.

---

**#69. What is a `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`?**

`BeanFactoryPostProcessor` allows modifying bean definitions before the container instantiates any beans.

Example:

```java
@Component
public class CustomBFPP implements BeanFactoryPostProcessor {
    public void postProcessBeanFactory(ConfigurableListableBeanFactory beanFactory) {
        // Modify bean definitions here
    }
}

```

**Gotcha:**

Runs before `BeanPostProcessor` and is used for configuration changes, not bean instance modification.

---

**#70. How can you define a default bean when multiple beans exist for a type?**

Mark it with `@Primary`.

Example:

```java
@Primary
@Component
public class DefaultProcessor implements Processor {}

```

**Gotcha:**

If `@Qualifier` is specified at injection point, it overrides `@Primary`.

### Easy #71‚Äì75

**#71. What is the purpose of `@Autowired(required = false)`?**
It tells Spring to inject the dependency if available, but not to fail if the bean is missing.

Example:

```java
@Autowired(required = false)
private Optional<AuditService> auditService;
```

**Gotcha:**
If you don‚Äôt handle the `null` case (or use `Optional`), you may get `NullPointerException` at runtime.

---

**#72. How do you inject prototype beans into singleton beans?**
Direct injection leads to a single instance being reused. Use `ObjectProvider` or `Provider<T>` to get a new instance each time.

Example:

```java
@Autowired
private ObjectProvider<Task> taskProvider;

public void execute() {
    Task t = taskProvider.getObject();
}
```

**Gotcha:**
Without this, the prototype scope won‚Äôt work as expected inside singleton beans.

---

**#73. What is the difference between `@PostConstruct` and `InitializingBean.afterPropertiesSet()`?**

* `@PostConstruct` ‚Äî annotation from `javax.annotation`, runs after dependency injection is complete.
* `afterPropertiesSet()` ‚Äî method from Spring‚Äôs `InitializingBean` interface, also runs after properties are set.

**Gotcha:**
Prefer `@PostConstruct` for cleaner, framework-independent code.

---

**#74. What is the use of `@DependsOn` in Spring?**
`@DependsOn` enforces initialization order between beans.

Example:

```java
@Component
@DependsOn("databaseInitializer")
public class ReportService {}
```

**Gotcha:**
It does not guarantee destruction order ‚Äî only initialization order.

---

**#75. How do you override a bean definition in Spring Boot?**
Define another bean with the same name in a configuration class. In Spring Boot 2.1+, bean overriding must be explicitly enabled:

```properties
spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true
```

**Gotcha:**
Overriding beans can break auto-configuration ‚Äî use cautiously and document clearly.

### Easy #76‚Äì80

**#76. How can you access the ApplicationContext from a bean?**
Implement `ApplicationContextAware` and override `setApplicationContext()`.

Example:

```java
@Component
public class MyBean implements ApplicationContextAware {
    private ApplicationContext context;

    @Override
    public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext ctx) {
        this.context = ctx;
    }
}
```

**Gotcha:**
This creates tight coupling to Spring ‚Äî avoid unless absolutely necessary.

---

**#77. What is the difference between `@Component` and `@Repository`?**
Both are stereotype annotations for component scanning, but:

* `@Repository` is for DAO/persistence layer beans and adds persistence exception translation.
* `@Component` is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed bean.

**Gotcha:**
The extra exception translation in `@Repository` is only applied when Spring‚Äôs persistence exception translation is enabled.

---

**#78. How do you programmatically register a bean at runtime?**
Use `ConfigurableApplicationContext`‚Äôs `getBeanFactory().registerSingleton()` or `registerBeanDefinition()`.

Example:

```java
@Bean
public ApplicationRunner runner(ConfigurableApplicationContext ctx) {
    ctx.getBeanFactory().registerSingleton("dynamicBean", new MyBean());
    return args -> {};
}
```

**Gotcha:**
Manually registered beans skip standard lifecycle callbacks unless explicitly invoked.

---

**#79. How can you inject a property from an external file not loaded by default?**
Use `@PropertySource` in a configuration class.

Example:

```java
@Configuration
@PropertySource("classpath:custom.properties")
public class AppConfig {}
```

**Gotcha:**
If file is missing, context startup will fail unless you set `ignoreResourceNotFound = true`.

---

**#80. How do you mark a bean to be loaded before others during startup?**
Use `@DependsOn` or `SmartLifecycle` with a lower phase value for early initialization.

Example:

```java
@Component
@DependsOn("earlyBean")
public class AnotherBean {}
```

**Gotcha:**
Early loading can slow startup ‚Äî only use when initialization order is critical.

### Easy #81‚Äì85

**#81. What is the difference between `@Configuration` and `@Component`?**

* `@Configuration` marks a class as a source of bean definitions using `@Bean` methods.
* `@Component` marks a class as a bean to be autodetected during component scanning.
* `@Configuration` classes are enhanced using CGLIB proxies to ensure singleton beans are returned even if `@Bean` methods are called multiple times.

**Gotcha:**
If you use `@Component` instead of `@Configuration` for a config class, calling `@Bean` methods manually will create new instances instead of returning the managed singleton.

---

**#82. How do you define a lazy-initialized bean?**
Use `@Lazy` at the class or method level to defer bean instantiation until it‚Äôs first requested.

Example:

```java
@Component
@Lazy
public class HeavyBean {}
```

**Gotcha:**
Lazy initialization can reduce startup time, but the first access to the bean may introduce a delay in execution.

---

**#83. How can you get all beans of a certain type?**
Inject a `Map<String, T>` or `List<T>` where `T` is the type of bean you want.

Example:

```java
@Autowired
private Map<String, PaymentProcessor> processors;
```

**Gotcha:**
The map keys are bean names, which can be useful for dynamic selection at runtime.

---

**#84. What is the difference between `@Autowired` and `@Inject`?**

* `@Autowired` is Spring-specific and supports features like `required=false`.
* `@Inject` is a JSR-330 standard annotation (from `javax.inject`) and is framework-agnostic.

**Gotcha:**
If you need `required=false`, you must use `@Autowired`; `@Inject` does not support it directly.

---

**#85. How can you inject values from command-line arguments or environment variables in Spring Boot?**
They are automatically available via the `Environment` and `@Value` annotations.

Example:

```java
@Value("${server.port}")
private int port;
```

**Gotcha:**
Spring Boot resolves properties from multiple sources with a defined precedence; command-line args override `application.properties`.

### Easy #86‚Äì90

**#86. What‚Äôs the difference between `ApplicationContext` and `BeanFactory`?**

* `BeanFactory` is the basic Spring container providing DI and bean lifecycle management.
* `ApplicationContext` extends `BeanFactory` and adds enterprise features like event publishing, internationalization, and AOP integration.

**Gotcha:**
In almost all modern Spring applications, `ApplicationContext` is used; `BeanFactory` is typically for lightweight or resource-constrained scenarios.

---

**#87. How do you conditionally create beans based on a property value?**
Use `@ConditionalOnProperty` in Spring Boot or a custom `@Conditional` in core Spring.

Example:

```java
@Bean
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "featureX.enabled", havingValue = "true")
public FeatureX featureX() {
    return new FeatureX();
}
```

**Gotcha:**
If you don‚Äôt specify `matchIfMissing=true`, the bean will not be created when the property is absent.

---

**#88. What‚Äôs the use of `@Qualifier` in Spring?**
It‚Äôs used to disambiguate beans when multiple candidates exist for injection.

Example:

```java
@Autowired
@Qualifier("paypalProcessor")
private PaymentProcessor processor;
```

**Gotcha:**
If you use `@Qualifier`, the bean name in the annotation must match exactly with the Spring bean name.

---

**#89. How do you provide default values when injecting properties with `@Value`?**
Use the `:` operator inside the placeholder.

Example:

```java
@Value("${timeout:5000}")
private int timeout;
```

**Gotcha:**
Default values are only applied if the property is missing, not if it‚Äôs present but empty.

---

**#90. How can you listen to application events in Spring?**
Implement `ApplicationListener<E>` or annotate a method with `@EventListener`.

Example:

```java
@EventListener
public void handleContextStart(ContextStartedEvent event) {
    // logic
}
```

**Gotcha:**
If you need asynchronous event handling, combine `@EventListener` with `@Async`.

### Easy #91‚Äì95

**#91. How do you profile-specific beans in Spring?**
Use `@Profile` to define beans that are only loaded for certain active profiles.

Example:

```java
@Bean
@Profile("dev")
public DataSource devDataSource() {
    return new H2DataSource();
}
```

**Gotcha:**
If no profile is active, beans without any `@Profile` annotation will still load, but profile-specific beans won‚Äôt.

---

**#92. How do you externalize configuration in Spring Boot?**
Use `application.properties` or `application.yml`, environment variables, command-line args, or config server integration.

Example (`application.properties`):

```
server.port=8081
```

**Gotcha:**
Spring Boot uses a well-defined property source order; values in environment variables and command-line args override those in property files.

---

**#93. What is the use of `@Primary`?**
It designates a bean as the preferred candidate when multiple beans of the same type exist.

Example:

```java
@Bean
@Primary
public PaymentProcessor defaultProcessor() {
    return new CreditCardProcessor();
}
```

**Gotcha:**
`@Primary` is overridden by `@Qualifier` when both are present.

---

**#94. How do you disable a specific auto-configuration in Spring Boot?**
Use `@SpringBootApplication(exclude = {ClassName.class})` or `@EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude = {ClassName.class})`.

Example:

```java
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = {DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class})
public class App {}
```

**Gotcha:**
The excluded class must be the actual auto-configuration class, not just a related configuration or bean.

---

**#95. How can you create immutable configuration properties in Spring Boot?**
Use `@ConfigurationProperties` with `final` fields and a constructor.

Example:

```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "app")
public record AppProperties(String name, int timeout) {}
```

**Gotcha:**
Immutable properties require either a `record` type or a class with only final fields and a constructor; setters are not needed.

### Easy #96‚Äì100

**#96. How can you access application arguments in Spring Boot?**
Inject `ApplicationArguments` into a bean.

Example:

```java
@Component
public class ArgsReader {
    public ArgsReader(ApplicationArguments args) {
        System.out.println("Non-option args: " + args.getNonOptionArgs());
        System.out.println("Option args: " + args.getOptionNames());
    }
}
```

**Gotcha:**
`ApplicationArguments` separates named options from plain arguments, which is useful for command-line parsing without manual string splitting.

---

**#97. What is the difference between `@SpringBootApplication` and `@EnableAutoConfiguration`?**

* `@SpringBootApplication` is a convenience annotation that combines:

  * `@Configuration`
  * `@EnableAutoConfiguration`
  * `@ComponentScan`
* `@EnableAutoConfiguration` alone only enables auto-configuration but does not scan for components outside its package scope.

**Gotcha:**
If you replace `@SpringBootApplication` with `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, you must explicitly add `@ComponentScan` to detect your beans.

---

**#98. How do you configure multiple property files in Spring Boot?**
Use `@PropertySource` for additional files or define multiple profiles in `application-{profile}.properties`.

Example:

```java
@PropertySource("classpath:extra.properties")
@Configuration
public class ExtraConfig {}
```

**Gotcha:**
`@PropertySource` does not support YAML files directly; use `.properties` or load YAML manually.

---

**#99. How do you change the active Spring profile at runtime?**
Set `spring.profiles.active` as a JVM argument, environment variable, or in property files.

Example (command line):

```
java -jar app.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod
```

**Gotcha:**
Changing profiles after the context is initialized requires a full context restart; profiles are not dynamically switchable.

---

**#100. How do you create a bean only if another bean is present?**
Use `@ConditionalOnBean` annotation.

Example:

```java
@Bean
@ConditionalOnBean(DataSource.class)
public JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate(DataSource ds) {
    return new JdbcTemplate(ds);
}
```

**Gotcha:**
Bean matching for `@ConditionalOnBean` happens at configuration time; if the dependent bean is created later, this condition won‚Äôt trigger.

### Medium #101‚Äì105

**#101. Explain the architecture of Spring MVC.**
Spring MVC follows the Front Controller pattern using `DispatcherServlet` as the central component:

1. **Request Handling:** `DispatcherServlet` intercepts all incoming requests.
2. **Handler Mapping:** Determines which controller method should handle the request.
3. **Controller Execution:** Invokes the method, returning a `ModelAndView` or data object.
4. **View Resolver:** Maps the view name to an actual view implementation (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf).
5. **Response Rendering:** The view is rendered and sent back to the client.

**Gotcha:**
If no view resolver is configured, and you return a view name, you‚Äôll get a `404` because Spring can‚Äôt resolve the logical name to a template.

---

**#102. How do you create a REST endpoint in Spring Boot?**
Use `@RestController` and mapping annotations like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`.

Example:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public User getUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return service.findById(id);
    }
}
```

**Gotcha:**
If you forget `@RestController` and use `@Controller` instead, without `@ResponseBody`, Spring will try to resolve a view instead of returning JSON.

---

**#103. How can you return custom HTTP status codes from a REST API?**
Use `ResponseEntity` or annotate the method with `@ResponseStatus`.

Example with `ResponseEntity`:

```java
@GetMapping("/health")
public ResponseEntity<String> healthCheck() {
    return new ResponseEntity<>("OK", HttpStatus.OK);
}
```

Example with `@ResponseStatus`:

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
@PostMapping("/users")
public void createUser(@RequestBody User user) { ... }
```

**Gotcha:**
`@ResponseStatus` is static; it cannot set status codes dynamically at runtime.

---

**#104. How do you validate incoming request data in Spring MVC?**
Use `@Valid` or `@Validated` with Bean Validation (JSR-380) annotations.

Example:

```java
public class UserDto {
    @NotNull @Size(min = 2)
    private String name;
}

@PostMapping("/users")
public void createUser(@Valid @RequestBody UserDto dto, BindingResult result) {
    if (result.hasErrors()) {
        throw new ValidationException(result.toString());
    }
}
```

**Gotcha:**
When using `@Valid` with `@RequestBody`, you must also have a `MethodValidationPostProcessor` or a default validator configured for it to work.

---

**#105. What is the difference between `@RequestParam` and `@PathVariable`?**

* `@RequestParam`: Extracts query parameters or form data.
* `@PathVariable`: Extracts values from the URI path.

Example:

```java
@GetMapping("/search")
public String search(@RequestParam String q) { ... }

@GetMapping("/users/{id}")
public String getUser(@PathVariable Long id) { ... }
```

**Gotcha:**
If you mismatch the path variable name with the method parameter name without explicitly specifying it in `@PathVariable("name")`, you‚Äôll get a binding error.

### Medium #106‚Äì110

**#106. How does Spring handle file uploads in a web application?**
Spring uses `MultipartResolver` to handle file uploads. In Spring Boot, `StandardServletMultipartResolver` is auto-configured when `spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=true` (default).

Example:

```java
@PostMapping("/upload")
public String handleFileUpload(@RequestParam("file") MultipartFile file) {
    return "Uploaded: " + file.getOriginalFilename();
}
```

Configuration in `application.properties`:

```
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=10MB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=15MB
```

**Gotcha:**
If `MultipartResolver` is not configured, uploaded files won‚Äôt be parsed, and `MultipartFile` parameters will be `null`.

---

**#107. How do you secure a REST API endpoint with Spring Security?**
Add Spring Security dependency and configure HTTP security rules.

Example:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/api/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
            .antMatchers("/api/**").authenticated()
            .and().httpBasic();
    }
}
```

**Gotcha:**
Without explicitly disabling CSRF for APIs (`csrf().disable()`), POST requests without a CSRF token will be rejected.

---

**#108. What is a `HandlerInterceptor` and how is it used?**
`HandlerInterceptor` allows pre- and post-processing of requests before they reach the controller or after the view is rendered.

Example:

```java
@Component
public class LoggingInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor {
    @Override
    public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res, Object handler) {
        System.out.println("Request URI: " + req.getRequestURI());
        return true;
    }
}
```

Register it:

```java
@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
    @Override
    public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {
        registry.addInterceptor(new LoggingInterceptor());
    }
}
```

**Gotcha:**
If `preHandle()` returns `false`, the request is not forwarded to the controller.

---

**#109. How do you implement exception handling in Spring MVC?**
Use `@ControllerAdvice` with `@ExceptionHandler` to centralize exception handling.

Example:

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleNotFound(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body(ex.getMessage());
    }
}
```

**Gotcha:**
`@ControllerAdvice` works across controllers only if it‚Äôs in a package scanned by Spring‚Äôs `@ComponentScan`.

---

**#110. What is the role of `ViewResolver` in Spring MVC?**
`ViewResolver` maps a logical view name returned by a controller to an actual view implementation (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf).

Example:

```java
@Bean
public InternalResourceViewResolver viewResolver() {
    InternalResourceViewResolver resolver = new InternalResourceViewResolver();
    resolver.setPrefix("/WEB-INF/views/");
    resolver.setSuffix(".jsp");
    return resolver;
}
```

**Gotcha:**
If multiple `ViewResolver`s are defined without order, Spring may pick the wrong one, causing unexpected rendering errors.

### Medium #111‚Äì115

**#111. How does Spring Boot simplify dependency management compared to classic Spring?**
Spring Boot uses ‚Äústarters‚Äù (like `spring-boot-starter-web`) to bundle commonly used dependencies and versions, reducing manual dependency configuration and compatibility issues.

**Gotcha:**
Including unnecessary starters can bloat your project; always verify transitive dependencies.

---

**#112. Explain the difference between `@RestController` and `@Controller`.**

* `@RestController` combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, so methods return data directly (JSON/XML).
* `@Controller` is used for traditional MVC returning view names.

**Gotcha:**
Using `@Controller` without `@ResponseBody` on REST endpoints causes Spring to look for view templates, often resulting in errors.

---

**#113. What is the purpose of `@RequestBody` and `@ResponseBody` annotations?**

* `@RequestBody` binds HTTP request body (usually JSON) to a Java object.
* `@ResponseBody` serializes the returned Java object to HTTP response (usually JSON).

**Gotcha:**
Without these, Spring treats parameters and return values as form data and view names respectively.

---

**#114. How do you handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Spring Boot?**
Use `@CrossOrigin` on controllers or methods or configure globally via `WebMvcConfigurer`.

Example:

```java
@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://example.com")
@GetMapping("/data")
public Data getData() { ... }
```

**Gotcha:**
Global CORS config takes precedence over method-level annotations.

---

**#115. How does Spring Boot actuator help in production?**
Provides ready-made endpoints for health, metrics, info, environment, and more, helping monitor and manage apps in production.

Example:
Access `/actuator/health` for health status.

**Gotcha:**
Sensitive endpoints must be secured to prevent information leakage.

### Medium #116‚Äì120

**#116. How can you configure custom error pages in Spring Boot?**
Place `error.html` in `src/main/resources/templates` for default error handling or create specific error pages like `404.html`, `500.html`. Alternatively, implement `ErrorController` to customize programmatically.

Example:

```java
@Controller
public class CustomErrorController implements ErrorController {
    @RequestMapping("/error")
    public String handleError() {
        return "customErrorPage";
    }
}
```

**Gotcha:**
Default Spring Boot error handling can override custom pages if not properly configured, ensure no conflicting error handlers exist.

---

**#117. What is the use of `@RestControllerAdvice`?**
Combines `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ResponseBody`. It globally handles exceptions for REST controllers and returns JSON responses.

Example:

```java
@RestControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
    @ExceptionHandler(EntityNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleEntityNotFound(EntityNotFoundException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body(ex.getMessage());
    }
}
```

**Gotcha:**
Without `@RestControllerAdvice`, exception handlers may return views instead of JSON in REST APIs.

---

**#118. How does Spring Boot support configuration via YAML files?**
Spring Boot can parse `application.yml` with hierarchical property support.

Example:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
```

**Gotcha:**
Indentation is critical; incorrect YAML format can cause startup failures.

---

**#119. How do you enable method-level security in Spring?**
Add `@EnableMethodSecurity` or `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` and use annotations like `@PreAuthorize` on methods.

Example:

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
public void deleteUser(Long id) { ... }
```

**Gotcha:**
Method security requires proxy-based Spring AOP; internal calls to secured methods within the same class won‚Äôt trigger security checks.

---

**#120. How does Spring Boot handle database schema initialization?**
Uses `schema.sql` and `data.sql` files by default or configures `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` property (`create`, `update`, `validate`, etc.) for Hibernate-managed schema updates.

**Gotcha:**
Using both SQL scripts and Hibernate auto-DDL together can cause conflicts; prefer one method in production.

### Medium #121‚Äì125

**#121. What are the key features of Spring Boot starters?**
Starters are dependency descriptors that bundle a set of related dependencies, simplifying Maven/Gradle setup. For example, `spring-boot-starter-web` includes Spring MVC, Jackson, and embedded Tomcat.

**Gotcha:**
Adding multiple overlapping starters can cause version conflicts or unnecessary dependencies.

---

**#122. How does Spring Boot‚Äôs `@SpringBootApplication` annotation work internally?**
It combines three annotations:

* `@Configuration` ‚Äî marks the class as a source of bean definitions.
* `@EnableAutoConfiguration` ‚Äî triggers Spring Boot‚Äôs auto-configuration mechanism.
* `@ComponentScan` ‚Äî enables scanning for components in the package and sub-packages.

**Gotcha:**
Placing your main class outside base packages may cause component scanning to miss beans.

---

**#123. Explain the difference between `@ComponentScan` basePackages and basePackageClasses attributes.**

* `basePackages` specifies package names as strings to scan.
* `basePackageClasses` specifies classes; Spring scans the package(s) of those classes.

Example:

```java
@ComponentScan(basePackageClasses = MyApp.class)
```

**Gotcha:**
Using `basePackages` with typos causes scanning issues; `basePackageClasses` is type-safe.

---

**#124. What is the use of `@EnableAutoConfiguration`?**
It tells Spring Boot to automatically configure beans based on classpath dependencies, environment, and other settings.

**Gotcha:**
You can exclude specific auto-configurations via `exclude` attribute if undesired.

---

**#125. How do you create a custom Spring Boot starter?**
Create a separate Maven/Gradle module containing dependencies and auto-configuration classes annotated with `@Configuration` and `@Conditional`. Include `spring.factories` file to register auto-configurations.

**Gotcha:**
Make sure your starter does not create bean definition conflicts with user applications.

### Medium #126‚Äì130

**#126. What is the difference between `@ComponentScan` and `@EntityScan`?**

* `@ComponentScan` tells Spring where to find beans/components like `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`.
* `@EntityScan` tells Spring Data JPA where to find entity classes for ORM mapping.

**Gotcha:**
Failing to use `@EntityScan` when your entities are outside the main package can cause runtime errors like `No identifier specified`.

---

**#127. How does Spring Boot‚Äôs actuator endpoint security work?**
Actuator endpoints can be secured by Spring Security, controlling access via roles or IP restrictions. You can configure endpoint exposure and security in `application.properties`.

Example:

```
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info
management.endpoint.health.show-details=when_authorized
```

**Gotcha:**
By default, sensitive endpoints like `/env` or `/beans` are not exposed and need explicit configuration.

---

**#128. How do you enable HTTPS in Spring Boot?**
Configure SSL properties in `application.properties` with keystore location and passwords.

Example:

```
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:keystore.p12
server.ssl.key-store-password=secret
server.ssl.keyStoreType=PKCS12
server.port=8443
```

**Gotcha:**
Failing to configure a valid keystore or missing SSL settings leads to startup errors or insecure HTTP fallback.

---

**#129. What is the purpose of `@ConditionalOnMissingBean`?**
It creates a bean only if no bean of the specified type is already registered, allowing users to override auto-configured beans.

Example:

```java
@Bean
@ConditionalOnMissingBean(DataSource.class)
public DataSource defaultDataSource() {
    return new HikariDataSource();
}
```

**Gotcha:**
If your custom bean‚Äôs type doesn‚Äôt match exactly, Spring Boot auto-configuration may still create a default bean causing conflicts.

---

**#130. How do you externalize sensitive credentials in Spring Boot?**
Use environment variables, encrypted property files (with Spring Cloud Config and Vault), or JNDI environment entries.

**Gotcha:**
Hardcoding credentials in `application.properties` is a security risk and should be avoided in production.
